"""
Initialize collection of class packages for application.

PURPOSE: Offer a variety of class modules for commonly used objects in
application. Class modules define object templates (e.g. dogs). They
usually identify specific object (instance) attributes (e.g. name is
Rover, age is 13 months), define class methods (i.e. actions performed
by object instances) (e.g. speaks name, rolls over), and sometimes
define class variables (e.g. scientific name: Canis lupus familiaris).

USAGE: 
  - import classes
